# numerical-methods-used-for-solving-system-of-linear-equations
## Objective
The aim of this project is to compare and analyze the behavior of the different 
numerical methods used for solving system of linear equations:
  1. Gauss Elimination.
  2. Gauss Jordan.
  3. LU Decomposition.
  4. Gauss Seidil.
  5. Jacobi Iteration.
## Description
The main purpose of this project is to implement linear system of equation program which takes as
an input system of linear equations, the method to use and its required
parameters if exists for this method.
